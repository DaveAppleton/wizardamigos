* What we will look at

- What tokens ARE
- What tokens ARE NOT
- ERC20 or Fungible Tokens
- ERC721 or non-fungible tokens
- Why you should follow standards
- What is NOT in the standards

* Token - the derivation

* What is a token?

Something that represents something else

- a turn at a game
- money
- mugs of coffee
- votes at a meeting
- seats for a concert

* Fungibility

- there is NO difference between each item
- you can add / subtract items

Are coins, stamps, bank notes fungible?

- Yes and/or NO

* The ERC20 Token

- Created by Fabian Vogelsteller, Vitalik Buterin
- A Fungible Token

Defines methods to

- transfer tokens (direct and delegated)
- get the individual balance of a token
- get the total supply of a token
- monitor the transfer of tokens (events)
- get the name, symbol, number of decimals

* The ERC721 Token

- represents things where each token is different 
- one owner can have many different tokens 
- each token has the same SET of attributes but of different values 
- each token has an ID 

The spec defines 

-  how you can identify the token from the ID 
-  how you can find which tokens an owner holds
-  (partially) how to mint new tokens
-  how to transfer (directly and delegated) 
- how to monitor the transfer of the tokens

* Token standards specify the commonality of features. You can add more.

- HelloGold's GOLDX token includes storage fees
- HelloGold's GOLDX has a novel distribution mechanism
- Some tokens have transfer fees
- Tokens can be frozen
- Tokens can interact (dragons can eat kitties!)

* ERC20 use cases

- utility tokens for use in an ecosystem
- represent fungible assets
- financial modeling

* ERC721 use cases

- kitties
- game items
- real estate
- anything real world
- loans
- artwork

* Ethereum Malaysia (currently only ETHKL)

- sponsored by Etherscan and HelloGold
- Hold 101 sessions and advanced coding sessions
